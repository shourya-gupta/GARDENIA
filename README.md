<strong>Detailed explanation:</strong>\
We present our unique idea THE GARDENIA.
As each and every plant requires adequate temperature, humidity, and perfect soil for its growth. We implement our idea keeping these utmost important requirements in mind.
Our <strong>GARDENIA</strong> imbibes various features as listed below:
1.	<strong>GARDEN GUIDE</strong> – This is the very first feature we brough out in front. It works in different phases.
First phase - It helps us to identify the type of soil we have and asks us about our current location. On choosing the appropriate soil type and location from the given list, we are directed to another web page which considers these parameters to yield the desired output. 
Second Phase – On the basis of user input, a variety of plants are suggested from our plants list which can be grown in his lawn/garden. Keeping user’s choice intact, we have provided user the choice through which he/she can easily pick the plants from the suggestions he/she would like to have. To keep things user friendly, we asked him/her for the measurements of their lawn/garden/
Third Phase - According to user’s input, we presented them with the final list of plants they could accommodate in their area. This list contains only those plants which were hand-picked by the him/her from the column of suggested plants.
Finally, we provide user with the quantity of each plant they chose to fill their garden with love.
