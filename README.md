<h3><strong>Detailed explanation:</strong></h3>
We present our unique idea <strong>THE GARDENIA.</strong><br>
We know each and every plant requires adequate temperature, humidity, and perfect soil for its growth. So, we have implemented our idea keeping these utmost important requirements in mind.
Our <strong>GARDENIA</strong> imbibes various features as listed below:<br>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>GARDEN GUIDE</strong> – It works in different phases.
        <ul>
             <li> <strong>First phase </strong>- It helps us to identify the type of soil we have and asks us about our current location. On choosing the appropriate soil type and location from the given list, the web page renders which considers these parameters to yield the desired output. </li>
            <li><strong>Second Phase</strong> – Based on user input, the server suggests a variety of plants which are suitable for their garden. Keeping user’s choice intact, we further provide them with the option to pick the plants from the suggested list. Also, we take the measurements of their garden for further customisation.</li>
            <li><strong>Third Phase</strong> - According to user’s input, we present them with a list of plants they can accommodate in their garden. Also, we provide user with the quantity of each plant, they wish to fill their garden with.</li>
       
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><strong>FIND GARDENERS</strong> - Here, the user gets a list of gardeners with their experiences, qualifications, etc. to provide services to them. These gardeners, are considered as a part of the company (future work). They are professional and highly reliable in their work. Users can easily appoint any of the gardener on their required date and time, and can also specify their requirements. We have also provided two methods for easier transaction - Card payment(integrated) or Cash on Delivery.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>BUY GREEN</strong> – This is like a small shopping website. It delivers all the products related to gardening and has features like - adding, deleting items, increasing/decreasing quantity of items, search by name, and a dynamically generated bill for the same using Vue.js.
    </li>

    <li><strong>LOG-IN</strong> – This has basic validations for passwords and also features like forgot password (future work: by using cloud functions, and buckets to store information), sign up, and flexibility to go between the webpages.
    </li>
    <li>
<strong>ABOUT US & CONTACT US</strong> – These webpages have their usual workings.
    </li>
    <li>
<strong>VIDEO TUTORIALS</strong> – It is a one-stop solution for all gardening tutorials, this webpage has embeded Youtube videos under appropriate taglines.
    </li>
</ol>
