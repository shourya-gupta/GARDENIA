Detailed explanation:
  We present our unique idea THE GARDENIA.
As each and every plant requires adequate temperature, humidity, and perfect soil for its growth. We implement our idea keeping these utmost important requirements in mind.
Our GARDENIA imbibes various features as listed below:
  1. GARDEN GUIDE – This is the very first feature we brough out in front. It works in different phases.
First phase - It helps us to identify the type of soil we have and asks us about our current location. On choosing the appropriate soil type and location from the given list, we are directed to another web page which considers these parameters to yield the desired output. 
Second Phase – On the basis of user input, a variety of plants are suggested from our plants list which can be grown in his lawn/garden. Keeping user’s choice intact, we have provided user the choice through which he/she can easily pick the plants from the suggestions he/she would like to have. To keep things user friendly, we asked him/her for the measurements of their lawn/garden/
Third Phase - According to user’s input, we presented them with the final list of plants they could accommodate in their area. This list contains only those plants which were hand-picked by the him/her from the column of suggested plants.
Finally, we provide user with the quantity of each plant they chose to fill their garden with love.
  2. FIND GARDENERS - This is a resourceful part of our website. Here, the user gets a list of gardeners with their experiences, qualifications, etc. to provide service to our users. These gardeners, are considered as a part of the company. They are professional and highly reliable in their work. Users can easily appoint any of the gardeners on their required date and time. We have provided two methods for easier transactions - Card payment or Cash on Delivery
  3. BUY GREEN – This is like a small shopping website. It gives all the products related to gardening and has features like - adding, deleting items, increasing/decreasing quantity of items, search by name, and a dynamically generated bill for the same.
  4. LOG-IN – This has basic validations for passwords and also features like forgot password, sign up, and flexibility to go between the webpages.
  5. ABOUT US, CONTACT US – These webpages have their usual workings.
